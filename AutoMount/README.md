Mount all your pets automatically with a customizable keybind. By default: **Ctrl + Shift + A**.

## How it works

It detects which characters in your active party have pets and are able to mount them and just mounts/dismount it on keybind detection. This means that it actually **toggles** the mounted state. Maybe in future updates it may take into account a global desired mounted state and apply it to all elegible characters.
