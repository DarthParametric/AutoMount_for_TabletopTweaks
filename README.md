# About

Mount all your animal companions automatically with a customizable keybind. Adapted for compatibility with TabletopTweaks and its Undersized Mount feat, allowing a rider to mount a pet of the same size class (e.g. human riding a level 1 wolf).

# Features
- Allows mount/dismount with a customizable keybind.
    - Mount: **Ctrl+Shift+A** (default).
    - Dismount: **Ctrl+Shift+D** (default).
- Auto mount when entering an area (toggleable).
- Whitelist/blacklist party members mounting by party slot position (default is all enabled). Includes provision for larger parties via the [More Party Slots](https://www.nexusmods.com/pathfinderwrathoftherighteous/mods/694/) mod, if installed.

# Notes
- Even though you can technically mount/dismount anywhere, any time (as long as the game allows it) it **will** consume your move action if you perform it while in combat.
- On mounting, riders will teleport directly to their respective mounts.
- If using the ToyBox cheat to autorest at the end of combat, you will be dismounted. No plans to change this.
- Enabling auto mount when entering an area may cause issues in certain cutscenes (e.g. Arueshalae dream sequences), but the dismount hotkey should work in these cases.
