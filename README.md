# FAQ

Ask and I shall answer.

# Planned upgrades
- Use party member names instead of party slot number.

# Notes
- You can make the mount/dismount toggleable by assigning the same keybind to both funcions.
- Even though you can tecnically mount/dismount anywhere anytime (as long as the game allows it) it **will** consume your move action if you perform it while in combat.
- On mounting riders will teleport to their respective mounts. I don't intend to implement any movement animation for the time being.
